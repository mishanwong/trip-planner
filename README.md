# Summary
This is a coding challenge for an interview.

# Requirements

1. Create an API with a single endpoint which accepts a country’s code in the World Bank’s 3 letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code format, and returns the name and capital of the country.
2. Add an endpoint that accepts four values: a minimum and maximum latitude, and a minimum and maximum longitude. The endpoint should return a list of capital cities located within those coordinates.
3. Build a third endpoint that accepts a list of 4 capital cities and returns the most efficient route between them. The list should include a starting city, an ending city, and 2 cities to visit along the way. Don’t worry about the actual logistics of planes and boats—instead find the shortest total miles traveled as the crow flies.
